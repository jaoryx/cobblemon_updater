# Cobblemon updater has been released!

## Options:
### Install modpack
- Install the modpack without having to do to much trouble downloading zips, unzipping, placing in correct directory's, ...
### Update modpack
- Install newly added mods by me through this software.
- This software works by using pastebins. I add links to add and mods to remove to the pastebin, the software will recognize updates. This also means that if there are older versions to be removed that you don't have to do that neither.
- This updater will be syncronized with the announcements channel in Discord meaning I will update the updater every time.
### Delete modpack
- If you are unsure how or what or you missed any updates or you just wanna stop playing, you can remove this modpack with this button.
